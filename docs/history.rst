- Fix documentation for :py:class:`rejected.data.Measurement`
- Alter logging levels for connection failures
- Add :py:attr:`rejected.testing.AsyncTestCase.measurement`

3.19.4
------

- Try to handle a MCP process cleanup race condition better (Sentry REJECTED-DA)

3.19.3
------

- Really fix a bug with the processing time and message age metrics

3.19.2
------

- Fix a bug with the processing time and message age metrics
- Catch a timeout when waiting on a zombie

3.19.1
------

- Fix a bug in the new durations code

3.19.0
------

- Sentry client changes:
  - Do not assign version, let the client figure that out
  - Do not specify the versions of loaded modules, let the client figure that out
- Add `rejected.data.Measurement.add_duration`, changing the behavior of
  recorded durations, creating a stack of timings instead of a single timing
  for the key. For InfluxDB submissions, if there is a only a single value,
  that metric will continue to submit as previous versions. If there are multiple,
  the average, min, max, median, and 95th percentile values will be submitted.
- Add `rejected.consumer.Consumer.stats_add_duration`
- Deprecate `rejected.consumer.Consumer.stats_add_timing`
- Deprecate `rejected.consumer.Consumer.stats_add_timing`
- Consumer tags are now in the format `[consumer-name]-[os PID]`
- Created a base exception class `rejected.consumer.RejectedException`
- `rejected.consumer.ConsumerException`, `rejected.consumer.MessageException`,
  and `rejected.consumer.ProcessingException` extend `rejected.consumer.RejectedException`
- If a `rejected.consumer.ConsumerException`, `rejected.consumer.MessageException`,
  or `rejected.consumer.ProcessingException` are passed a keyword of `metric`,
  the consumer will automatically instrument a counter (statsd) or tag (InfluxDB)
  using the `metric` value.
- `rejected.consumer.ConsumerException`, `rejected.consumer.MessageException`,
  and `rejected.consumer.ProcessingException` now support "new style" string formatting,
  automatically applying the args and keyword args that are passed into the creation
  of the exception.
- Logging levels for exceptions changed:
  - `rejected.consumer.ConsumerException` are logged with error
  - `rejected.consumer.MessageException` are logged with info
  - `rejected.consumer.ProcessingException` are logged with warning
- Fix the handling of child startup failures in the MCP
- Fix a bug where un-configured consumers caused an exception in the MCP
- Handle the edge case when a connection specified in the consumer config does not exist
- Refactor how the version of the consumer module or package is determined
- Add `ProcessingException` as a top-level package export
- Fix misc docstrings
- Fix the use of `SIGABRT` being used from child processes to notify the MCP when
  processes exit, instead register for `SIGCHLD` in the MCP.

------

- Add connection as an attribute of channel in ``rejected.testing``
- Refactor how error text is extracted in ``rejected.consumer.Consumer.execute``
- When a message raises a ProcessingException, the string value of the exception is added to the AMQP message headers property
- Messages dropped by a consumer can now be republished to a different exchange

3.17.4
------

- Don't start consuming until all connections are ready, fix shutdown

3.17.3
------

- Fix publisher confirmations

3.17.2
------

- Don't blow up if `stats` is not defined in config

3.17.1
------

- Documentation updates
- Fix the test for Consumer configuration

3.17.0
------

- `rejected.testing` updates
- Add automatic assignment of `correlation-id` to `rejected.consumer.Consumer`
- Only use `sentry_client` if it’s configured
- Behavior change: Don't spawn a process per connection, Spawn `qty` consumers with N connections
- Add State.is_active
- Add attributes for the connection the message was received on and if the message was published by the consumer and returned by RabbitMQ
- Deprecate `PublishingConsumer` and `SmartPublishingConsumer`, folding them into `Consumer` and `SmartConsumer` respectively
- Refactor to not have a singular channel instance, but rather a dict of channels for all connections
- Add the ability to specify a channel to publish a message on, defaulting to the channel the message was delivered on
- Add a property that indicates the current message that is being processed was returned by RabbitMQ
- Change `Consumer._execute` and `Consumer._set_channel` to be “public” but will hide from docs.
- Major Process refactor
    - Create a new Connection class to isolate direct AMQP connection/channel management from the Process class.
    - Alter Process to allow for multiple connections. This allows a consumer to consume from multiple AMQP broker connections or have AMQP broker connections that are not used for consuming. This could be useful for consuming from one broker and publishing to another broker in a different data center.
    - Add new ``enabled`` flag in the config for statsd and influxdb stats monitoring
    - Add a new behavior that puts pending messages sent into a ``collections.deque`` when a consumer is processing instead of just blocking on message delivery until processing is done. This could have a negative impact on memory utilization for consumers with large messages, but can be controlled by the ``qos_prefetch`` setting.
    - Process now sends messages returned from RabbitMQ to the Consumer
    - Process now will notify a consumer when RabbitMQ blocks and unblocks a connection
